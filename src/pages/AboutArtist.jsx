        For the first time, I saw painted flowers on the walls of a clay house
        in my grandmother's village in Petrykivka, Dnipropetrovsk region when I
        was 10 years old. Bright flowers, birds and amazing plots captured my
        childhood imagination.

        The Ukrainian tradition of wall painting in peasant's houses existed as
        early as 300 years ago. Many generations of native masters from
        Petrykyvka carefully passed down their skills from grandmother to
        granddaughter, preserving the traditions and sacred meanings of the
        patterns. No one in my family drew. However, my father always supported
        my creativity. So, thanks to him, I became more familiar with the
        special Ukrainian ethnic painting.

        The Druzhba factory worked in the village of Petrikivka for 40 years, so
        my father sent me to study with the famous artist Fyodor Panko. And it
        was in the workshops of the factory that I saw an unusual way of
        painting berries and flowers with my fingers. The brushes were also
        homemade from cat fur and were called "kittyka". At the factory,
        painters painted bright wooden caskets, plates, spoons, chests, etc. in
        huge batches. Therefore, almost every Ukrainian person has an idea about
        the Petrykiv painting. I was lucky to see all technological processes
        and learn to distinguish Ukrainian painting from others thanks to the
        technique and symbolism that I learned in childhood.

        Already at a mature age, I remembered the ability to draw Petrykiv
        painting. Over time, I created a creative studio "Zernyatko" in Lviv. My
        goal became to reproduce the flowering of Petrykivka that I once saw in
        my childhood. And now, for 12 years, my mission has been to master and
        popularize the Petrykiv painting. I teach children and adults and
        continue to study myself.

        I use finger painting as art therapy nowadays, as well as drawing small
        elements with a "cat" in order to master Ukrainian ethnic calligraphy.
        All this develops fine motor skills in children and forms creative
        thinking.

        To date, I have had many exhibitions in Ukraine and 16 personal
        exhibitions abroad, namely in Poland, Spain, France and Turkey.

        I work as an art psychologist in Lviv and abroad. Currently, I am
        working on my 2 manuals about Petrikovsky painting. In addition, several
        methods with the basics of painting and psychological influence on the
        development of children's motor skills are being refined. The manuals
        are intended for the work of teachers and psychologists with art therapy
        painting, as well as for people who want to master Petrykiv painting
        without a teacher.

        For almost 350 years of the folk wall painting existence, the Petrykiv
        painting has turned into an art that has been recognized as an
        intangible UNESCO heritage. The symbolism and skill of artists is
        enriched. But the tools and painting techniques still remain primitive,
        which distinguishes Petrykiv painting from other types of applied art.
