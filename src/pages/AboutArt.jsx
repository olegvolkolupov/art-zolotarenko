        Petrykivâ€™s painting is a characteristic layer of the culture of the
        Ukrainian nation, recognized around the world as a phenomenon of
        national thinking and artistic imagination. It originated as a
        phenomenon 300 years ago in the village of Petrykivka in Dnipro (Eastern
        Ukraine).

        Petrykivka did not know serfdom. Free Zaporozhye Cossacks lived there.
        Around the people there were steppe lands, chernozems, rich flora on the
        Dnieper. Cossacks builtclay houses of clay with roofs made of reeds.

        The villagers decorated their windows, doors and walls with flowers,
        birds, and berries. People had naive faith in their drawings - they were
        supposed to protect them from ghosts. Over time, this folk art began to
        develop on porcelain, wooden objects, and book graphics. Over three
        centuries, thousands of artists perfected their skills, turning the
        painting of a small village into pan-Ukrainian art. Since 2005,
        Petrykowski's design has been recognized as UNESCO's intangible
        heritage.

        In Soviet times, the "Druzhba" factory operated in Petrykivka for many
        years, where a huge number of patterns on a black background were
        produced for export. Later, Petrykivka returned to the light background.
        But the crates are still painted on a colored background.

      <p>
        Modern Petrykiv painting is a folk art that has unusual ways of drawing.
        By drawing with fingers, sticks and brushes from cat hair, they create
        delicate patterns, amazing shapes and fantastic color combinations.
        Images are transformed into a fabulous world.
